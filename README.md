This repository hosts a notebook featuring an in-depth analysis of 2 **Pytorch EfficientNet** models, along with an app deployment using Gradio. The following models were meticulously evaluated:

- EffNetB0
- EffNetB2

The dataset used has been downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species) and contains a set of 525 bird species. 84635 training images, 2625 test images(5 images per species) and 2625 validation images(5 images per species).

The app can be tested in **Hugging Face** following this [link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/bmartinc80/birds_pytorch).
