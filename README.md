This project has been developed as part of the [MLOps Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp) course provided by [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club/).

The dataset used has been downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hellbuoy/car-price-prediction) and a preliminary data analysis was performed (see [notebooks](/notebooks) folder), to get some insights for the further project development.
